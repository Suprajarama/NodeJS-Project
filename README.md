# NodeJS-Project
This repository showcases three full-stack web application projects built as part of the CSC587 course: *Modern Web Applications Using Server-Side Technologies*. Each project explores essential backend development concepts using Node.js, Express.js, EJS templating, and MongoDB.
The first project focuses on dynamic data rendering and basic form handling. It includes two partsâ€”one that displays the current server-side date and time using EJS, and another that allows users to be added, viewed, and deleted through simple forms and page routing.
The second project introduces MongoDB integration using Mongoose and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. It demonstrates how user data can be stored, retrieved, updated, and deleted in a persistent database, with clean separation of logic through controllers and EJS-based views.
The third project builds a RESTful API server that connects to MongoDB and provides endpoints for interacting with user data. It also includes a client-side script that consumes this API using the Fetch API, showcasing a complete client-server communication flow using REST principles.
Each project is modular and runs independently. To run any project, navigate to its folder, install the dependencies using `npm install`, and start the server with `node app.js` or `npm start`. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application in action.
